## Migrating from MQL4 to MQL5: Guidance for Algorithmic Traders
### Tutorial 2 - Accessing OHLCV and Bid/Ask Prices in MQL5 vs MQL4

This tutorial shows algorithmic traders using MetaTrader 4 (MQL4), how to retrieve current BID / ASK and historical OHLCV prices in MQL5 (MetaTrader 5). 

MQL4 makes these accessible via pre-defined variables Bid and Ask, and arrays Open, High, Low, Close, Time and Volume.

### In MQL5, the same prices can be retrieved in 3 ways, via:

1) iTime, iOpen, iHigh, iLow, iClose and iTickVolume
2) CopyTime, CopyOpen, CopyHigh, CopyLow, CopyClose, CopyTickVolume functions
3) CopyRates, using the MqlRates struct

All content is specifically geared towards algorithmic traders currently using MQL4, with the aim of making a case for transition from MQL4 to MQL5, and providing the knowledge needed to ensure it is a smooth, educated endeavour.
