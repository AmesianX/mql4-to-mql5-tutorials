## Tutorial 3 - Accessing Symbol Information in MQL5 vs MQL4
### Migrating from MQL4 to MQL5: Guidance for Algorithmic Traders

This tutorial describes how to access Symbol data in MQL5.

#### Specifically, we discuss:

1) The differences between MQL4 and MQL5 in the context of the:

- SymbolInfoDouble
- SymbolInfoString and, 
- SymbolInfoInteger functions.

2) MQL4's MarketInfo function

3) The additional property identifiers that MQL5 brings to the table in the SymbolInfo___ functions

4) Why and how the above render the MarketInfo function unnecessary (hence it being deprecated) in MQL5

5) How having the extra detail in MQL5 can benefit trading strategy developers currently using MQL4.
