## Tutorial 1 - Differences between MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5.
### Migrating from MQL4 to MQL5: Guidance for Algorithmic Traders

With this series of tutorials, we aim to educate MetaTrader 4 (MQL4) users on the benefits of MetaTrader 5 over its predecessor MetaTrader 4.

All content is specifically geared towards algorithmic traders currently using MQL4, with the aim of making a case for transition from MQL4 to MQL5, and providing the knowledge needed to ensure it is a smooth, educated endeavour.

In this 1st video, we discuss the key differences between the two platforms that are relevant from an MQL programmer's perspective, and lay out the way forward.

Enjoy!
